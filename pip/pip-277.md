# Motivation

After configuring the geo-replication on Pulsar clusters, the `clusters list` API will return multiple clusters, including the local Pulsar cluster and remote clusters like

```
bin/pulsar-admin clusters list
us-west
us-east
us-cent
```
But in this return, you can't distinguish the local and the remote cluster. When you need to remove the geo-replication configuration, it will be hard to decide which cluster should be removed on replicated tenants and namespaces unless you record the cluster information.

# High Level Design

Add `local` flag to distinguish clusters
```
bin/pulsar-admin clusters list
us-west(local)
us-east
us-cent
```
