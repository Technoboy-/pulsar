# Motivation

There is a config in ServiceConfiguration called `disableBrokerInterceptors` introduced by #8157, it looks to disable the broker interceptor, but commented for using test only. 
In actual, we judge whether enable the interceptor by judging whether the broker is loaded into the interceptors. Then in #10489, it kept the same implementation.
But #20422 has changed the behavior, it judges whether enable the interceptor by `disableBrokerInterceptors` and then it caused an NPE issue mentioned in #20710.
This config has a little confusing, so we decide to delete it.

# Goals

Delete config `disableBrokerInterceptors`.


# Backward & Forward Compatibility
